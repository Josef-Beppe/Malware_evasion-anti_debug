## Anti-debug
Contains various methods for debug detection. Executable code can this way be protected against reverse engineering.\
Anti-debugging is very system specific in nature. This code was made on 64-bit Windows 10 with GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).\
Its functionality on different environment can not be ensured!

# If you code something new, write it here!!!

### Currently implemented methods
- simple IsDebuggerPresent()
- TLS Callback
- NtGlobalFlag
- heap Flags and ForceFlags
- CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent()
- Primitive half-functional exception call (not SEH)

### Possible improvements
- More methods <- Current focus
- Make it work for 32-bit OS
- Make it work for 32-bit program on 64-bit OS
- Make it work for Windows XP and older
- Pack it all in one class: Resolve OS version and 32/64-bit on object inicialization, then pass offset values as a parameter to methods
- Create and use the class object in TLS Callback
